**API**

Wikipedia API is used here. This API was the best option across other "dummy data" APIs. However it searches in both _title_ and _content_ of a wiki article and sometimes it doesn't recognize autocomplete query. I did my best to prioritize _title_ filtering

I decided not to use local JSON file for the data to show a real life scenario with server data fetching
